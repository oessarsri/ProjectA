## About Projet A 

Project A is an ecommerce platform that helps people send gifts to their beloved ones using web/mobile application
solutions.

Project A operations team started delivery in 3 cities: Casa, Rabat and Tangier. In each city we have a partner who is
the supplier and the distributor of the gift products.
Rabat: Mohamed (flowers, chocolate)
Casa: Hassan (flowers, perfumes, chocolate)
Tangier: Nada (flowers)
Each supplier has certain delivery dates/times during the year in which he can operate to deliver gift orders to their
receivers. We suppose that each city contains one partner.
The partners’ delivery time spans are:
Mohamed “9->12”, “14->18”
Hassan “10->13”, “15->19”
Nada “9->13”, “14->18”, “18-20”
To manage the changes and updates in delivery dates and times, so they can be reflected to customers on the website
and mobile app, when choosing order details in the checkout, we need to create some endpoints, and integrate them
into Project A website and admin interfaces.
